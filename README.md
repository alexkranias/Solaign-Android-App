# Solaign
Created by Alex Kranias & Ayush Pai.

Solaign is a mobile tool to maximize the power output of your solar panels! Often times residential solar panels are not oriented correctly, leading to much of the sunlight they could capture over the course of months, years, or even decades to be lost to poor panel alignment. Solaign uses the same rigourous solar positioning algorithims found in national labs, scientific publications, and atmospheric sciences research to find the best alignment for your personal solar panel instillation! The idea to create this app was from Alex Kranias after writing his Physics Extended Essay on "Maximizing the Energy Production of a Fixed-Tilt Solar Cell"; Alex took the methodology in his research paper and wanted to generaize his results for all possible time periods and locations in the world, and package it all into a user friendly app that could be used by solar panel instillation companies and individual solar panel owners to have a tool to assess the effectivness of their solar instillation. The hope is that through this app, we can help get the most out of the millions of residential solar panels installed today, and the millions more yet to be installed.

## How the App Works
Solaign make's use of J.J. Michalsky's Solar Position Algorithim (1988) and preliminary software written by Martin Rymes of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (March 1998) translating much of Michalsky's algorithim into C++, which we translated to Java, and  uses vector projection and equations describing the atmosphere's effect on solar irradiance (solar energy) to calculate the total energy captured by a solar panel over a given time period. They key is that by using gradient descent, our algorithim is able to quickly and efficently calculate the optimal position needed of a solar panel to maximize how much energy it captures over the user-inputed time period for the user's specific location on Earth. With this information, the app presents it to users in simple set of instructions for them to position their panels at the optimal position just calculated. While this app is currently (8/3/2022) extremely accurate for locations with little to no rain or cloud cover throughout the year, Alex is currently searching for APIs and/or scientific databases to feed our algorithim hourly weather data for every locaiton on Earth in addition to finding proper equations that accurately describe the effect of cloud cover on the sun's intensity (solar irradiance) in order to make our application one of the most accurate solar positioning tools availible.
